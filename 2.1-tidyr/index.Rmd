# Using `tidyr`, `dplyr`

- Writing readable code using **pipes**
- What is **tidy data**? Why do you want tidy data? Getting your data into tidy form using tidyr.
- Reading different **data formats**
- String operations, working with **text**

---
# The pipe operator `%>%`

- `x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`
- part of `dplyr` package
- pipes allow the code to be *read* like a sequence of operations

Example:

```{r}
student2012.sub <- readRDS("../data/student_sub.rds")
# table(student2012.sub$CNT)
student2012.sub %>% group_by(CNT) %>% tally()
```

---
# What is **tidy data**? 

- Why do we want tidy data? 
- Couple of exercises to look closer at what we find in practice 


---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 1

What are the variables?

```{r echo=FALSE}
grad <- read_csv("../data/graduate-programs.csv")
head(grad[c(2,3,4,6)])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
in the columns, subject, Inst, AvNumPubs, ...
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 2

What's in the column names of this data? What are the experimental units? What are the measured variables?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
genes <- read_csv("../data/genes.csv")
head(genes)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
the experimental design is coded into the variable names, genotype:WI/WM, time:6/12, rep:1/2/4
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 3

What are the variables? What are the records?

```{r echo=FALSE}
melbtemp <- read.fwf("../data/ASN00086282.dly", 
   c(11, 4, 2, 4, rep(c(5, 1, 1, 1), 31)), fill=T)
head(melbtemp[,c(1,2,3,4,seq(5,100,4))])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
variables are TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, year, month, day, stationid. Each row contains the values for one month!
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 4

What are the variables? What are the experimental units?

```{r echo=FALSE}
tb <- read_csv("../data/tb.csv")
tail(tb)
#colnames(tb)
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 5 

What are the variables? What are the experimental units?

```{r echo=FALSE}
pew <- read.delim(
  file = "http://stat405.had.co.nz/data/pew.txt",
  header = TRUE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  check.names = F
)
pew[1:5, 1:5]
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 6

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(french_fries, package = "reshape2")
head(french_fries, 4)
```

What is the experimental unit? What are the factors of the experiment? What was measured? What do you want to know?

# Messy Data Patterns

There are various features of messy data that one can observe in practice. Here are some of the more commonly observed patterns:

- Column headers are values, not variable names
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns, contingency table format
- One type of experimental unit stored in multiple tables
- Dates in many different formats

---
# What is Tidy Data?

- Each observation forms a row
- Each variable forms a column
- Data is contained in a single table
- Long form makes it easier to reshape in many different ways
- Wide form is common for analysis

# Tidy Verbs

- `gather`: specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures) to make long form (used to be called melting)
- `spread`: variables in columns (used to be called casting)
- `nest`/`unnest`: working with list variables
- `separate`/`unite`: split and combine columns

---
# French Fries 

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(french_fries)
```

---
# What Would We Like to Know?

- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other?
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?

Each of these questions involves different summaries of the data.

---
# Gathering

When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

- Keys/Identifiers:
  - Identify a record (must be unique)
  - Example: Indices on an random variable
  - Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
  - May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

- Values/Measures:
  - Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
  - Usually numeric quantities

---
# Gathering the French Fries

```{r}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = 
                    rating, potato:painty)
head(ff_long)
```

---
# Long to Wide

In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (perhaps displaying in a table).

This is called "spreading" the data.

---
# Spread

We use the **spread** function from `tidyr` to do this:

```{r}
french_fries_wide <- spread(ff_long, key = variable, 
                            value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

---
# Answer some Questions

- Easiest question to start is whether the ratings are similar on the different scales, potato'y, buttery, grassy, rancid and painty. 

- We need to gather the data into long form, and make plots facetted by the scale. 

---
# Ratings on the Different Scales

```{r}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
  gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep)
head(ff.m)
```

--

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2) + 
  facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5) 
```

---
# Side-By-Side Boxplots

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=type, y=rating, fill=type)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


---
# Do the Replicates Look Like Each Other?

We will start to tackle this by plotting the replicates against each other using a scatterplot. 

We need to gather the data into long form, and then get the replicates spread into separate columns. 

---
# Check Replicates

```{r}
head(ff.m)
```


```{r}
ff.s <- ff.m %>% spread(rep, rating)
head(ff.s)
```

---
# Check Replicates

```{r, fig.show='hold', fig.align='default', fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2")
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + 
  scale_x_sqrt() + scale_y_sqrt()
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

![](lorikeets.png)

Make the scatterplots of reps against each other separately for scales, and treatment. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5)
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_grid(treatment~type)
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

![](lorikeets.png)

Read in the billboard top 100 music data, which contains N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs that entered the billboard charts in the year 2000

```{r}
billboard <- read.csv("../data/billboard.csv")
```

What's in this data? What's X1-X76?

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

![](lorikeets.png)

1. Use `tidyr` to convert this data into a long format appropriate for plotting a time series (date on the x axis, chart position on the y axis)
2. Use `ggplot2` to create this time series plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
long_billboard <- gather(billboard, key = week, value = rank, X1:X76)
long_billboard$week <- as.numeric(gsub("X", "", long_billboard$week))

#ggplot(data = long_billboard, aes(x=week, y=rank, colour = artist, group = track)) + geom_line() + theme(legend.position="bottom")

# alternative:
ggplot(data=long_billboard) + geom_line(aes(x=week+lubridate::week(date.entered), y=rank, group=track, colour=artist)) + theme(legend.position="bottom")
# the backstreet boys' 2nd song of the year 'flopped'
```


---
# String Manipulation

When the experimental design is packed into column names, we need to extract it, and tidy it up. 

```{r}
genes <- read_csv("../data/genes.csv")
head(genes)
```

---
# Gather Column Names into Long Form

```{r}
gather(genes, variable, expr, -id) 
```

---
# Separate Columns

```{r}
genes %>%
  gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") 
```

---

```{r}
genes %>%
  gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
  separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") 
```

---

```{r}
gtidy <- genes %>%
  gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
  separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") %>%
  mutate(trt = sub("W", "", trt)) %>%
  mutate(rep = sub("R", "", rep))
head(gtidy)
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

![](lorikeets.png)

(1) Using the tidied dataset (`gtidy`), find the mean expression for each combination of id, trt, and time.
(2) Use this tidied data to make this plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
gmean <- gtidy %>% 
  group_by(id, trt, time) %>% 
  summarise(expr = mean(expr))
ggplot(data = gtidy, aes(trt, expr, colour = time)) + 
         geom_point() + 
  xlab("Type of modification") + ylab("Expression") + 
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  geom_line(data = gmean, aes(group = time))
```

# Tidying model output

The package `broom` gets model results into a tidy format at different levels

- for each model: `broom::glance`
- for each coefficient in the model: `broom::tidy`
- for each value in the dataset: `broom::augment`

```{r}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = 
                    rating, potato:painty)
ff_lm <- lm(rating~variable+treatment+time+subject, 
            data=ff_long)

```

---
# Goodness of fit statistics: `glance`

```{r}
glance(ff_lm)
```

---
# Model estimates: `tidy`

```{r}
ff_lm_tidy <- tidy(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_tidy)
```

---
# Model diagnostics: `augment`

```{r}
ff_lm_all <- augment(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_all)
```

---
# Residual plot

```{r}
ggplot(ff_lm_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
```

---
# Back to autism

Fit a random slopes model to the data:

$$vsae = \beta_0 + \beta_1 age2 +  b_1 childid + \varepsilon$$

```{r results='hide'}
library(lme4)
data(autism)
autism_keep <- autism %>% group_by(childid) %>% 
  tally(sort=TRUE) %>% filter(n>2)
autism_sub <- autism %>% 
  filter(childid %in% autism_keep$childid)
autism_lmer <- lmer(vsae ~ age2 + ( age2 - 1 | childid ), 
                    data = autism_sub)
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

- Augment the autism data with the model diagnostics
- Plot the residuals from the (a) fixed, (b) random effects
- Color the residuals by (a) gender, (b) besttest2
- Plot fitted values against observed values

![](lorikeets.png)

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
autism_lmer_all <- augment(autism_lmer, autism_sub)
glimpse(autism_lmer_all)
ggplot(autism_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.fixed)) + geom_point()
ggplot(autism_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
ggplot(autism_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid, colour=gender)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(autism_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid, colour=bestest2)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(autism_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=vsae, label=childid)) +
  geom_point()
library(plotly)
ggplotly()
ggplot(autism_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=vsae, label=childid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group=childid))
```
